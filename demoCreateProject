# Perfect! You're ready to start coding inside your Django project (firstProject). Here's what you can do next depending on what kind of code you want to try:

# ✅ STEP-BY-STEP: Try Code in Your Django Project
# ✅ 1. Activate Your Virtual Environment

# In your terminal (inside VS Code), run:

# cd ~/Desktop/INT253\ DJANGO/firstProject
# source env/bin/activate


# You should see:
# (env) at the beginning of the terminal line.

# ✅ 2. Start the Server to Make Sure It's Working
# python manage.py runserver


# Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000

# You should see the Django welcome page.

# ✅ 3. Create Your First App (If Not Done Yet)

# A Django project can have multiple apps. Run:

# python manage.py startapp myapp


# Now you’ll see a new folder myapp/ inside firstProject.

# ✅ 4. Register the App in Your Project

# Open this file:
# 📄 firstProject/first/settings.py

# Find the section: INSTALLED_APPS
# Add 'myapp', like this:

# INSTALLED_APPS = [
#     'django.contrib.admin',
#     'django.contrib.auth',
#     ...
#     'myapp',  # 👈 add this
# ]

# ✅ 5. Write Some Code: Create a View

# Inside 📄 myapp/views.py, add this:

# from django.http import HttpResponse

# def home(request):
#     return HttpResponse("Welcome to my first Django app!")

# ✅ 6. Configure a URL for the View

# Create a file called urls.py inside myapp/

# Add this code to it:

# from django.urls import path
# from . import views

# urlpatterns = [
#     path('', views.home, name='home'),
# ]


# Now link it to your main project:

# Open 📄 firstProject/first/urls.py
# And edit it like this:

# from django.contrib import admin
# from django.urls import path, include  # include is important

# urlpatterns = [
#     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#     path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # 👈 this connects your app
# ]

# ✅ 7. Now Run Your Server Again
# python manage.py runserver


# Open your browser and go to:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# You’ll see:
# “Welcome to my first Django app!” ✅

# Let me know if you want to:

# Connect to a database

# Create models and do migrations

# Use HTML templates (with Django template engine)
# Just say what you want to try next!
