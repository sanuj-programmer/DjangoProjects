Perfect! Let’s start fresh and create your Django projects the right way — each with its own virtual environment and folder. Follow these steps:

🧹 Step 0: Delete old folders

; If you want to delete everything and start clean:

cd ~/Desktop/INT253\ DJANGO/
rm -rf testenv first


(Only do this if you don’t need your first project anymore)

; 🏗️ Step 1: Create a folder for your project
cd ~/Desktop/INT253\ DJANGO/
mkdir FirstProject
cd FirstProject

; 🐍 Step 2: Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

; ⚡ Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate


; You’ll see your prompt change to:

(venv) sanuj ~/Desktop/INT253 DJANGO/FirstProject $

; 📦 Step 4: Install Django inside the venv
pip install django

; 🚀 Step 5: Start your Django project
django-admin startproject first .   


The dot . creates the project in the current folder instead of adding an extra subfolder.


; 6. Run Migrations
python manage.py migrate

; 🧪 Step 7: Run the server
python manage.py runserver


; Your Django app will now run at:   // till here for creating first project
http://127.0.0.1:8000       

; Create Your First App (If Not Done Yet)

; A Django project can have multiple apps. Run this to create app:
python manage.py startapp myapp            //Recommended cmd to create app 
django-admin startapp myapp               // Alternate cmd to create app 



Now you’ll see a new folder myapp/ inside firstProject.

; 🔁 To Exit a Virtual Environment:
deactivate


✅ Recommended structure (per-project isolation):
Create a folder for each project, like this:

~/Desktop/INT253 DJANGO/
│
├── FirstProject/
│   ├── venv/              ← your virtual environment (optional but recommended)
│   └── first/              ← Django *project folder* (configuration)
    └── myapp/             ← Django *app folder* (your logic)
    └── manage.py/             
│
├── SecondProject/
    ├── venv/              ← another separate env
    └── second/            ← second project code

; ✅ Final Summary
Folder	Purpose
first/	Django project (settings, routing, config)
myapp/	Django app (business logic, views, models, etc.)
firstProject/	Your root project folder (can include env, README, etc.)





; 📝 Step 7: Create another project (later)?

; 🔧 Steps to set up a new Django project with its own venv:
; Let’s say you want to create SecondProject:


cd ~/Desktop/INT253\ DJANGO/
mkdir SecondProject
cd SecondProject

# Step 1: Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Step 2: Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install Django inside the venv
pip install django

# Step 4: Create Django project inside this folder
django-admin startproject second .

# Step 5: Run it
python manage.py runserver
Note: startproject second . ← the dot creates the project in the current folder instead of a subfolder.

✅ Benefits:
Full isolation: no conflicts between projects.

Easier to deploy/manage.

You can delete/zip/move the project folder anytime — everything it needs is inside.

; 📂 Your Folder Layout
~/Desktop/INT253_DJANGO/
│
├── FirstProject/
│   ├── venv/              ← Virtual environment (isolated Python/Django setup)
│   ├── first/             ← Django project folder (configuration files)
│   ├── myapp/             ← Django app folder (your feature logic)
│   └── manage.py          ← Project management script
│
├── SecondProject/
│   ├── venv/              ← Separate virtual environment for 2nd project
│   └── second/            ← Django project folder (configuration files)

🛠️ Explanation of Each Part
; 🔹 1. venv/ (Virtual Environment)

This is a self-contained Python environment.

Each project has its own venv → prevents conflicts (e.g., one project uses Django 4, another uses Django 5).

Activate it before working:

source venv/bin/activate

; 🔹 2. manage.py

Command-line tool to interact with your project.

Examples:

python manage.py runserver → starts the server

python manage.py startapp myapp → create a new app

python manage.py makemigrations / migrate → database handling

Always run commands from the folder containing manage.py.

; 🔹 3. first/ (Project Folder)

This is created when you run django-admin startproject first ..
It holds project-level configuration:

__init__.py → makes it a Python package.

settings.py → project settings (apps, database, debug, static files).

urls.py → project-wide URL routes.

asgi.py / wsgi.py → entry points for web servers (deployment).

Think of this as the control center of your Django project.

; 🔹 4. myapp/ (App Folder)

This is created with python manage.py startapp myapp.
It holds your application logic:

views.py → functions/classes that handle requests and return responses.

urls.py → app-level URL patterns (must be linked in project urls.py).

models.py → database models (tables).

admin.py → register models for Django Admin.

apps.py → app configuration.

tests.py → write unit tests.

migrations/ → files to apply database schema changes.

You can have many apps inside one project (e.g., blog, shop, accounts).

⚙️ How Django Works (Request Flow)

When you open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/:

Browser sends request → Django server receives it (runserver).

manage.py ensures Django runs using your settings.

urls.py (project level) decides which app should handle the request.

urls.py (app level) maps the request to the correct view.

views.py runs your Python function/class.

The view may:

Return simple text (HttpResponse)

Render an HTML template

Query a database (via models.py)

Response sent back → Browser shows result.

📌 Example: Your "Hello, Sanuj!" Project

Browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Project urls.py:

path('', include('myapp.urls'))


App urls.py:

path('', views.show_name)


App views.py:

return HttpResponse("Hello, Sanuj!")


Browser output:

Hello, Sanuj!


✅ So in short:

Project folder (first/) = global settings

App folder (myapp/) = your features (views, models, templates)

manage.py = control panel

venv = isolated Python/Django environment
